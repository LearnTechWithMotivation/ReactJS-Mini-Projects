## ⚠️ Notes

* This project uses [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/) (if applicable). If deploying to GitHub Pages, configure it properly for SPA routing.
* To fix broken routes on GitHub Pages, you can add a `_redirects` file (for Netlify) or configure `404.html` fallback (for GitHub Pages using `HashRouter` or `gh-pages`).

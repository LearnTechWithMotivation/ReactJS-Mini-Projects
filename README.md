## ⚠️ Notes

* This project uses [React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/) for page navigation.
* If you're deploying to **GitHub Pages**, make sure to:

  * Use `HashRouter` instead of `BrowserRouter` (or)
  * Use the [`gh-pages`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) package and set the correct `homepage` in your `package.json`.
  * Add a `404.html` file that redirects all routes to `index.html` if needed.
